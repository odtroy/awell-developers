## Webhooks & events

You can leverage webhooks to track events happening within Awell and send them to any destination (Segment, Amplitude, Google Analytics, ...).

## Connect to Awell's data repository (Elastic)

We use [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/) as our data repository to store, index, and search care flow data sets. You can either **connect your own BI tool** to our data repository in Elastic or **use our analytics & dashboarding tool: Kibana**.

Both Elastic and Kibana are running on our own infrastructure.

## Create dashboards with Kibana

We use [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) for dashboarding & data visualization. If you choose to work with Kibana (and not your own BI tool), please ask your customer success manager to create accounts. In Kibana, you're able to create an unlimited amount of dashboards.

Integrations with your identity provider to log into Kibana are possible.
